                <h2>What Does A Web Developer Do?</h2>
                <p>Web development is the process of building, developing, and maintaining websites and applications for the internet or an intranet (a private network). It ranges from creating simple, static, plain-text pages to complex social media applications.</p>

                <h2>What Are Best Practices?</h2>
                <p>Best practices are an industry-accepted set of guidelines. They represent the most efficient or sensible course of action. These practices standardize the most effective way to achieve a desired outcome. They are usually laid down by either external, regulatory authorities, or they can be established internally by an organization’s management.</p>

                <li>Start By Planning</li>
                <p>The first step of a project should be to identify the overall goal. Simplifying the user-interface of an e-commerce app or customizing a retail website are both examples of project goals.</p>
                <hr class = "li_hr">
                <li>Stick To The Standards</li>
                <p>Creativity can often help developers devise unique solutions for tricky problems. But deviating too far from industry norms often results in failure. Simply put, there are some industry norms that just work, and some that don’t.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Web development is no exception to this concept. Some industry norms for web development are as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The navigation map should be the same for all pages of your website. It makes your website more uniform and coherent.</li>
                    <li>There is an ‘ideal’ position for every feature, particularly on the homepage. While the company logo should be at the top-left corner of the homepage, contact information, organizational details, and registration options should be towards the top-right.</li>
                    <li>The size of the hyperlinks should be appropriate and easily visible to the user.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr class = "li_hr">
                <li>Code Smarter, Not Longer</li>
                <p>Every line of code that you write should fulfill a necessary and particular purpose. Avoid writing anything too complex that could make your code hard to understand and edit in the future. Writing code without a defined purpose invites bugs into your program. Each line of code should provide an important feature to a webpage or solve a specific problem. Also, you should realize the value of code commenting: a practice of inserting short, single-line notes throughout your code. These notes allow you to easily understand why a code snippet works in a particular way or what is it intended for.</p>
                <hr class = "li_hr">
                <li>Sprint, Don’t Leap   </li>
                <p>Website development is a rigorous process of improvement, and it thrives on incremental updates rather than implementing huge features at once. Whether it’s a minor change in fonts or introducing a new feature, incremental updates create fewer errors and bugs than full updates do.</p>               
                <br>
                <p>The trick is to maintain a balance between today’s demand and future innovation. The user-interface created today will naturally become outdated a few months or years down the line. Therefore, it’s imperative to design and develop the backend accordingly. This makes sure that the User Interface (UI) can be modified in the future without doing a complete overhaul.</p>
